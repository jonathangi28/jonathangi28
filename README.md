- 👋 Hi, my name is Jonathan, it is nice to meet you. I currently live in Addison, Texas!
- 👀 I’m open to new opportunities as a Frontend Web Developer.
- 🌱 I'm always learning something new. As I learn new skills I like to put them into practice and will show through my projects here overtime.
- 📝 Take a look at my GitHub projects. If you feel called to, contribute to one of my projects. Constructive criticism will help improve my skills.
- 📫 I get too much spam on my e-mail, so instead, please connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathangillman01/" target="_blank">Linkedin here</a> and say Hello!
